==========
2. I chose Bosko, Clutch, and Santa animations mainly because there seemed to be a good selection of all of them, and that all of them started with different letters; thus sorting is preferred.
  I was able to alphabetically sort the series by generalizations on the alphabet.
3. Begin at index.html, which pairs with style.css. This will be the homepage of the site, and there are subpages for each of the series (since multiples of episodes for each)
  which will be in the folder 'categories'. In there, you can view the animations on the page, or click the external links to bring you to internet archive.
